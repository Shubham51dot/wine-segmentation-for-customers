# Segmentation of wine
### In this dataset there are lot of parameters to segment or distribute the wine to different types of customers
### To classify the important independent variables from the dataset I used three types of methods to reduce the dimensions
1. PCA(principal component analysis)
2. LDA(Linear discriminant analysis)
3. Kernel PCA
### With the help of these techniques I got accuracy as follows:-
1. PCA-97%
2. LDA-100%
3. Kernel PCA-96%
###As you can see by using LDA for this dataset it gave me 100% accuracy with logistic regression classifier
